# IMAGE CAPTIONING PROJECT 

An image captioning project made with Tensorflow in Google Colab

# Goal

The goal of this project is producing meaningful captions for given images.
Captioning images is an attention taking task in recent years which connects Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision. In this project a model is introduced that is a
combination of recurrent and convolutional neural network architectures. First 
convolutional network is used to extract features from images which describe the visual
characteristics of them like edges, shapes and color densities. Then a recurrent
network architecture is used to combine semantic information ,which gathered from given captions,
and visual characteristics of these images to make network learn how to produce meaningful
captions. Also  an attention module is used to focus on more related parts of images that
have relatively more impact on generating captions.
